# SecureTalk
SecureTalk is a chatting application built using the MERN stack.  This is an application that enables users to connect on Local LANs (of small or large size) without having to worry about their chats being transferred insecurely. It currently only supports text-based chats. The primary motivation for building this application is to learn MERN.
